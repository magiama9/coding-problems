# Best Restaurant Problem

## The Problem

Locate the problem statement in the included pdf. Think through the problem before you start to code. Look at the test cases located in `solve.test.js` to see what you need to work towards.

## The Code

Run `npm install` or `yarn` once you have downloaded the repo.

I have included tests written in Jest that you can run with `npm run test` or `yarn test`.

A complete solution should have all of the test cases pass. If you get stuck thinking about the problem, look at how the tests are set up.

## The Solution

If you would like to run the solution, copy `/solution/solve.js` into your main directory and run `yarn test` or `npm run test`.

My solution is just one way to approach the problem. Your solution might be better!

## What Now

Your code passes the tests...awesome! You have achieved your MVP! If you were to continue iterating and building out the solution, what would you improve?

Think about how to handle edge cases or how to make your code more efficient. What happens if two restaurants have the same score?
