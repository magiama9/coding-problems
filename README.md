# coding-problems
This is a repository of coding problems that I've worked on or encountered in technical interviews.

Where possible, I have tried to include a clear problem statement, a commented solution, and tests for you to run. 

My solution is always just one solution. There are always multiple ways to solve a problem, and as long as your solution works (and hopefully passes the tests) it's perfectly valid.

## Problems Included

* [Best Restaurant](https://github.com/magiama9/coding-problems/tree/master/enovational) -- Find the restaurant that's the best match for a group of coworkers to go out to lunch.

* [Fence Builder](https://github.com/magiama9/coding-problems/tree/master/expensive-fence) -- You want to make the biggest fence you can on your paltry $1,000,000 budget.

* [Fizz Buzz](https://github.com/magiama9/coding-problems/tree/master/fizz-buzz) -- The classic! Return numbers from 1 to n, replacing numbers with "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz" depending on certain conditions.

## Testing

Tests are run using Jest. A large portion of the reason I began this repo was to practice writing unit tests using Jest. If your solution is built to return information in a different way than the tests are written, the tests might fail. Try to tailor your solution to the tests rather than the tests to your solution. 

TDD, baby.

## Adding Problems

If you have problems you would like to add, feel free to open a pull request after following these steps.

1. Make sure the lesson it's teaching is not already duplicated in the included problems.
2. Name the directory the name of the problem or company where you encountered it (or both!)
3. As much as possible, strive to include a clear and concise problem statement/readme, a well-commented solution, and unit tests.

Thank you for your contribution!
