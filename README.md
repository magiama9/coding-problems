# coding-problems
This is a repository of coding problems that I've worked on or encountered in technical interviews.

Where possible, I have tried to include a clear problem statement, a commented solution, and tests for you to run. Tests are run using Jest.

My solution is always just one solution. There are always multiple ways to solve a problem, and as long as your solution works (and hopefully passes the tests) it's perfectly valid.

## Problems Included

* [Best Restaurant](https://github.com/magiama9/coding-problems/tree/master/enovational) -- Find the restaurant that's the best match for a group of coworkers to go out to lunch.
