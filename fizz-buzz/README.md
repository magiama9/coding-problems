# FizzBuzz Problem

## The Problem

The oldest one in the book!

Create a function that returns an array containing all the numbers from 1 to (n). If a number is evenly divisible by 3, replace it with "Fizz". If a number if evenly divisible by 5, replace it with "Buzz". If a number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5, replace it with "FizzBuzz".

## The Code

Run `npm install` or `yarn` once you have downloaded the repo.

I have included tests written in Jest that you can run with `npm run test` or `yarn test`.

A complete solution should have all of the test cases pass. If you get stuck thinking about the problem, look at how the tests are set up.

## The Solution

If you would like to run the solution, copy `/solution/solve.js` into your main directory and run `yarn test` or `npm run test`.

My solution is just one way to approach the problem. Your solution might be better!

## What Now

Your code passes the tests...awesome! You have achieved your MVP! Think about why your solution works and why other solutions might run into problems.
